## Project
1. This project is a prototype, a landing page for car and picking a car of the user choice
2. There are no "sign in" for this project (Maybe in the future, connecting to the AppWrite as Databases)
3. I added the smoothscroll after when the user click submit button to view more to smooth scroll to the car list because Next.JS have a bug when it's in client side it automatically move to the top of the page when the URL change
